# BlueIRC
An event-based IRCv3.2 library

Canary branch contains development code while Master branch contains stable code

# Contributions

Even though I am working hard to maintatin this library, it is open for all kinds of contributions, even to this README, they are much needed, I am trying to make the ultimate IRC library for Java, something new, elegant, neat, modern, secure, and of course, open source
